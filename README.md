I'm a software developer with an artist bent.
I have a little over 3 years of professional experience as a developer working in many
capacities, the major ones being:
 - Game Programming (AI)
 - Distributed Systems / Network Architecture
 - and Back-end Web Development

I'm very passionate about FOSS and I look forward to collaborating with and learning from new people.
I'm also available for freelancing and mentoring.
